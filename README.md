**The Hidden Text Detector**
 
Hidden Text Detector (HTD) is a Windows application designed to identify and reveal concealed text in PDF, Word, and Excel documents. This tool is essential for document analysis, compliance verification, and security auditing.
The application detects hidden content using advanced heuristics, including microfonts (under 4pt), white or near-white text, and documents with hidden text attributes. This helps users uncover potentially concealed information that may not be immediately visible.

Use Cases: Document forensics, compliance auditing, intellectual property protection, and transparency verification. 
This tool is intended for legitimate purposes such as security research, document verification, and compliance checking. Users are responsible for ensuring they have the proper authorisation to analyse documents.

Disclaimer: The code presented here is intended for an Install app. However, Windows security will probably block its execution. 
The downloadable ZIP file is available at https://zenodo.org/records/18217095 (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18217095). Unzip the folder and activate “HTD Analyzer.exe”.
I have also attached a simple PDF file, “Test_document.pdf”, which identifies white text and 0,9 font.
